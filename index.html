<p id="tbn1"><img src="c:\Users\USER\Downloads\forex-trading-course.jpeg" width="500" height="400" style="float: left;"><br>Forex (Foreign Exchange) is the global, decentralized market for trading currencies, the world's largest financial market, operating 24/5 where participants buy and sell currency pairs (like EUR/USD) to profit from exchange rate fluctuations, facilitate international business, or hedge risks. It's known for its high liquidity and accessibility through online brokers, allowing speculation on currency movements using leverage. 
Key Aspects of Forex Trading:
Global & Decentralized: No central exchange; it's a network of banks, corporations, and traders worldwide.
24/5 Operation: Opens Sunday evening (ET) and runs until Friday evening, moving through major financial centers (Tokyo, London, New York).
Currency Pairs: Currencies are traded in pairs (e.g., GBP/USD), where you buy one while selling the other to bet on their relative strength.
Liquidity: The sheer volume of daily trades makes it the most liquid market.
Participants: Includes individuals, corporations (for goods), banks, and central banks.
Trading Methods: Speculation (profit), hedging (risk reduction), and arbitrage.
Leverage: Allows traders to control large positions with small capital, magnifying both profits and losses. 
How It Works (Simplified):
Choose a Pair: Select a currency pair (e.g., EUR/USD).
Analyze: Predict if the base currency (EUR) will strengthen or weaken against the quote currency (USD).
Place Trade: Buy (go long) if you expect the EUR to rise, or sell (go short) if you expect it to fall.
Profit/Loss: If your prediction is right, you profit; if wrong, you lose. 
Common Terms:
Pip (Point in Percentage): The smallest price movement, usually the fourth decimal place (e.g., 0.0001).
Spread: The difference between the buy (ask) and sell (bid) price, which is the broker's fee.
Leverage: Borrowed capital to amplify trade size. </p>

    Don't trade on emotions, stick to your trading plan and utilize stop-losses. Stay current, you will over trade against yourself. Start small, learn from experience, refine techniques for beginners.<br>
New traders enter futures trading with dreams of quick riches, only to discover that emotions — not markets — become their biggest enemy. Fear and greed create a predictable pattern: Overconfidence after early wins leads to oversized positions. Revenge trading after losses compounds mistakes.<br>
